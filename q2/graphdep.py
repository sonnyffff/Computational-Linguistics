        Creates a boolean mask that indicates which candidate dependencies are
        possible

        We can tell a priori that some arcs are disallowed. For example,
        regardless of the scores assigned to them, we know that loops (edges
        between a vertex and itself) are not valid dependencies. Similarly, we
        can infer a constraint on which arcs can be assigned the root
        dependency relation (label).

        Implement this function so that it returns a boolean tensor of the
        given shape, where each entry indicates whether that position in the
        tensor corresponds to an allowable dependency (both arc and label).
        Remember that all you know is the candidate head, dependant, and
        dependency relation, so none of the contraints you represent here
        involve how edges might interact. You also don't know anything about
        the sentence lengths here, so you aren't to try to mask out padding
        values (that is already done for you in the lengths2mask method).
        The starter code creates a tensor of the relevant shape that allows
        all possibilities: you must set the disallowed entries to False.

        In your report, include a brief writeup (~1 paragraph per constraint)
        that explains which constraints you enforce and how you do so.

        Args:
            shape (Sequence[int]): the shape for this batch. There are four
                dimensions: (batch_sz, y, x, self._n_deprels)

        Returns:
            A boolean Tensor, where each element is True if and only if a
            dependency corresponding to that element is allowable. In other
            words, element at index (b, i, j, k), ask whether it is possible
            for there to be a dependency from vertex j to vertex i having
            dependency relation k, based solely on the values of i, j, and k.
            (The value for the first dimension indexes the batch dimension, so
            is irrelevant to this.)

            IMPORTANT:
            * The ROOT vertex is at position 0; i.e., the element at index
              (b, i, 0, k) indicates a dependency *from* ROOT to vertex i with
              dependency relation k.
            * The root dependency relation has value 0; i.e., the element at
              index (b, i, j, 0) indicates a dependency from vertex j to vertex
              i with dependency relation (i.e., label) root.

            HINT: You don't need to know the indices for the other dependency
            relations; the text above tells you everything you need to know,
